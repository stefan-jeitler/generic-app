# Generic App

A generic app without any use case.  
The main purpose of this project is to get familiar with Github as code hosting platform.
My goals is to create a monorepo with multiple apps where each app can be deployed indenpendently.  

All deployable apps in this repo get a unique human readable identifier that I call **technical id**. 
Right now, there are two of them. **web-api** and **client-app**.
